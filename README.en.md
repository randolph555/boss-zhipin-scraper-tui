A lightweight **BOSS Zhipin scraper / crawler** (a.k.a. spider) for job listings on [zhipin.com](https://www.zhipin.com). Instead of driving a heavy Selenium/Playwright browser, it connects to your **already-logged-in Chrome** via the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP), reuses the real session, and calls the in-page search API directly — bypassing the front-end font-based anti-scraping so you get the **plaintext salary** in every record. Output goes to JSON / CSV, plus an aggregated salary/skill analysis and a copy-paste prompt for polishing your job-application materials. Also ships as a Hermes Agent Skill.

> 📌 **In one sentence**: no Selenium/Playwright — connect to your logged-in Chrome over CDP, hit the search API with the real session, get JSON/CSV with plaintext salaries, plus salary-distribution, skill-frequency stats and a résumé-optimization prompt.

## 🚀 30-Second Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone + install deps
git clone https://github.com/eatmoreduck/boss-zhipin-scraper.git
cd boss-zhipin-scraper
pip install -r requirements.txt          # or: uv sync

# 2. Launch an isolated Chrome and log in (only once; session persists)
python3 scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py --setup-chrome

# 3. Scrape + analyze
python3 scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py --keyword "AI Agent" --city 上海 --pages 3 --analysis

# 4. Generate an aggregated summary + prompt after scraping (reads the latest result)
python3 scripts/job_summary.py

# Optional: realtime terminal browser (no offline JSON; live CDP paging/detail)
python3 scripts/boss_live_tui.py --keyword "AI Agent" --city 上海
```

Right after scraping you get: salary ranges, experience requirements, top skill keywords, and a job-application optimization prompt. The prompt is based solely on the scraped job data — it never reads your local résumé file and never scores personal-job match.

## ✨ Features

- Plaintext salary (API mode, bypasses font-based obfuscation)
- Dual JSON / CSV output
- Detail-page JD scraping + skill analysis
- Realtime terminal TUI (Textual): list, paging, preview, on-demand detail fetch
- Aggregated summary + copy-paste prompt after scraping
- Incremental writes (no data loss on crash)
- One-shot environment check + persistent isolated Chrome CDP profile
- Multi-dimension filters (scale, funding, salary, experience, degree, industry)
- macOS + Linux support (a Windows code path is reserved but untested — not guaranteed to work)

<details>
<summary>🔍 Why not a Selenium / Playwright crawler?</summary>

- Selenium/Playwright spins up a full instrumented browser — it's heavy, has an obvious fingerprint, and is easily flagged by BOSS Zhipin's risk-control / CAPTCHA.
- This tool connects to your own already-logged-in Chrome (via CDP), reusing a real fingerprint and session, and calls the same legitimate search API the page uses. The `salaryDesc` it returns is already plaintext — no need to parse font-obfuscated DOM salaries.
- The result is more stable than traditional DOM-scraping crawlers and harder to flag as automated traffic.

## Installation

### Option 1: Clone then install locally (recommended)

Because `hermes skills install` may not reach GitHub directly in some environments, clone the repo first and install locally:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/eatmoreduck/boss-zhipin-scraper.git
cd boss-zhipin-scraper

# 2. Copy into the Hermes skills directory
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/scripts
cp SKILL.md ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/
cp scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/scripts/
cp scripts/job_summary.py ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/scripts/
```

### Option 2: One-line curl install

No need to clone the whole repo — download just the files you need:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/scripts && \
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eatmoreduck/boss-zhipin-scraper/master/SKILL.md \
  -o ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/SKILL.md && \
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eatmoreduck/boss-zhipin-scraper/master/scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py \
  -o ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py && \
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eatmoreduck/boss-zhipin-scraper/master/scripts/job_summary.py \
  -o ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/scripts/job_summary.py
```

### Option 3: `hermes skills install` (requires direct GitHub access)

```bash
hermes skills install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eatmoreduck/boss-zhipin-scraper/master/SKILL.md --category data-science
```

> Note: this depends on the hermes process being able to reach GitHub directly. If you hit a timeout or connection failure, use Option 1 or 2.

### Verify the installation

```bash
# Check that the files exist
ls ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/SKILL.md
ls ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py
ls ~/.hermes/skills/data-science/boss-zhipin-scraper/scripts/job_summary.py
```

After installing, just say in a Hermes conversation: "Search BOSS Zhipin for AI Agent jobs in Shanghai."

## Use as a CLI tool

You don't have to install it as a Skill — use it as a plain CLI:

```bash
# 1. Clone + install deps
git clone https://github.com/eatmoreduck/boss-zhipin-scraper.git
cd boss-zhipin-scraper
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Start Chrome CDP
python3 scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py --setup-chrome
# First run won't copy your main Chrome session; log in to zhipin.com in the dedicated BOSS browser that pops up
# setup waits for login to finish and confirms the API returns plaintext salaries

# 3. Check the environment
python3 scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py --check

# Optional: real browser/API smoke test (writes no result files)
python3 scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py --smoke-test

# 4. Scrape
python3 scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py --keyword "AI Agent" --city 上海 --pages 3 --format csv --analysis

# 5. Realtime terminal browser (Chrome CDP only; no local JSON reads)
python3 scripts/boss_live_tui.py --keyword "AI Agent" --city 上海

# 6. Summary + prompt after scraping
python3 scripts/job_summary.py --top 15
```

## Parameters

## Realtime Terminal TUI

`scripts/boss_live_tui.py` is a Textual terminal interface. It only reads live data through Chrome CDP and never reads offline JSON files:

```bash
python3 scripts/boss_live_tui.py --keyword "AI Agent" --city 上海
# Or after installing the package
uv run boss-live --keyword "AI Agent" --city 上海
```

Controls:

- `n` / `→` / `PageDown`: fetch next page live
- `p` / `←` / `PageUp`: fetch previous page live
- `Enter` / select a row with the mouse: open the detail page live and extract JD
- `d` / `u`: scroll the detail panel down / up
- `m`: open the in-TUI message center and view conversations/unread replies
- `Esc` / `j`: return from message center to job list
- In message mode, `Enter`: open a conversation; type in the bottom input and press `Enter` to send
- In job mode, `g`: prepare a greeting; press `g` again to confirm clicking BOSS's "start chat" action
- `r`: refresh current page
- `q`: quit

If CDP is not running or BOSS is not logged in, it asks you to run `python3 scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py --setup-chrome` first.

Messaging and greeting actions operate through the real BOSS web page:

- While the TUI is open, it polls conversations every 60 seconds and shows unread replies in the status bar; if one poll returns empty, it keeps the previous conversation list
- Replies are only sent after you type them and press Enter
- Greeting requires pressing `g` twice to avoid accidental sends
- No batch messaging and no automatic generated-send behavior

For page-structure debugging, run the read-only probe:

```bash
uv run boss-message-probe --url https://www.zhipin.com/web/geek/chat --click-first
```

### AI / MCP Extension Point

The realtime TUI does not embed AI chat yet, but the live data layer is kept separate from the UI:

- `LiveBossClient.fetch_page()`: fetch a list page live
- `LiveBossClient.fetch_detail()`: fetch the selected job detail live
- `LiveBossClient.fetch_conversations()` / `fetch_current_chat()`: fetch conversations and chat records live
- `LiveBossClient.build_agent_context()`: return a JSON-serializable job context for future MCP tools, in-TUI AI chat, or Codex/Claude Code integration

The recommended next stage is to expose an MCP/agent interface first, instead of hard-wiring model calls into the TUI. The TUI can stay focused on browsing and selecting jobs, while AI tools operate on the current job context for résumé rewriting, interview prep, and job-risk checks.

## Post-Scrape Summary & Prompt

`scripts/job_summary.py` only reads the already-scraped `boss_jobs_*.json` and `boss_details_*.json`, does simple aggregation, and produces a copy-paste prompt. It never reads your local résumé file, pulls in no PDF dependency, and never scores a person against a job.

```bash
# Read the newest boss_jobs_*.json under the default result dir and auto-match the same-timestamp or newest detail file
python3 scripts/job_summary.py

# Specify list and detail files
python3 scripts/job_summary.py \
  --input ~/.boss-zhipin-scraper/job-result/boss_jobs_20260625_1200.json \
  --details ~/.boss-zhipin-scraper/job-result/boss_details_20260625_1200.json \
  --top 15

# Only emit the prompt
python3 scripts/job_summary.py --prompt-only
```

After installing the package you can also use the entry command:

```bash
uv run boss-summary --top 15
```

The summary covers: salary ranges, experience requirements, degree requirements, regional distribution, top companies, skill tags, frequent JD terms. The prompt asks the model to use these stats to fill in résumé keywords, suggest project-story rewrite directions, and produce an interview-prep checklist — while explicitly instructing it not to fabricate experience.

## How It Works

This is a Chrome-CDP-based BOSS Zhipin crawler. Core flow:

1. Connect to an already-open Chrome via the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)
2. Inject JS inside the BOSS Zhipin page that calls the search API via synchronous XHR
3. The API returns plaintext `salaryDesc`, bypassing the front-end font obfuscation
4. The list API preserves `securityId` / `lid` context, carried into the detail page
5. Each page is written to disk immediately, deduped by `job_id`

DOM extraction is not used for the list by default, since DOM salaries may be hit by font-based obfuscation. Only when `--allow-dom-fallback` is explicitly passed will it fall back to DOM when the API returns no data.

`--input ... --analysis --no-detail` first loads `--detail-output`, then the `boss_details_*.json` with the same timestamp in the same dir as the input list, and finally the newest detail file under `~/.boss-zhipin-scraper/job-result`.

## Chrome Profile Security Policy

`--setup-chrome` uses a persistent isolated profile by default — it neither symlinks nor copies your main Chrome data. First launch and subsequent launches only create or reuse this dedicated profile:

- `~/.boss-zhipin-scraper/chrome-profile`

Without an explicit `--output` or `--detail-output`, scraping results are saved under:

- `~/.boss-zhipin-scraper/job-result`

On first use you must log in to BOSS Zhipin manually inside this dedicated Chrome. `--setup-chrome` waits for the login to finish and uses the search API to confirm it can get plaintext `salaryDesc` before returning. The session is stored inside the dedicated profile and survives reboots; re-running `--setup-chrome` does not wipe it and does not affect your main Chrome, Gmail, GitHub, or other accounts.

If you really need to import the BOSS session from your main Chrome, run explicitly:

```bash
python3 scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py --setup-chrome --copy-login-state
```

`--copy-login-state` overwrites the corresponding cookie-related files inside the isolated profile on every run; do not pass this for daily launches. It only copies `Local State` and `Default/Cookies*`, `Default/Network/Cookies*`-style cookie database files — not password stores, history, extensions, or a full profile. To wipe the dedicated browser's login state:

```bash
python3 scripts/boss_cdp_raw.py --setup-chrome --reset-chrome-profile
```
